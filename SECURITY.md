# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please use this repository's private vulnerability-reporting form under the GitHub **Security** tab when it is available. If it is unavailable, open a minimal issue asking the maintainer for a private contact channel; do not include exploit details in that issue.

请优先通过 GitHub **Security** 页面中的私密漏洞报告功能联系维护者。如果该入口不可用，请只创建一个不含利用细节的简短 issue，请求私下沟通渠道。

Never include DeepSeek API keys, credentials files, session contents, raw logs, or unredacted balance data in a report. Revoke any credential that may already have been exposed.

报告中不要附带 DeepSeek API key、凭据文件、会话内容、原始日志或未脱敏余额。已经暴露的凭据应立即吊销。

## Scope

Security fixes target the latest version on the default branch. The nine read-only data endpoints are designed for direct loopback use only; exposing them through a reverse proxy is outside the supported security model unless the proxy adds authentication and access control. The integration route's `GET` response contains only availability booleans. Its `POST` performs the user's explicit, revision-guarded `llm-pi-ai.providers.orcarouter` path mutation and additionally requires JSON plus the non-simple `X-DSH-Usage-Stats-Action: add-orcarouter` header; plugin startup never performs this write.

CSV and JSON exports are fixed, versioned projections of normalized usage and account-safe metadata. They do not serialize plugin/provider configuration, credential references or values, raw upstream responses, prompts, replies, or file paths. CSV text fields are quoted and guarded against spreadsheet-formula execution; incomplete monetary derivations remain blank/null.

Declarative account monitors are trusted local configuration, but they still default to HTTPS, same-origin relative paths, manual redirects, JSON-only responses, and a 1 MiB response limit. Before sending credentials, the plugin filters IPv4/IPv6 DNS answers and pins one validated address for the connection. Public addresses are preferred. For HTTPS hostnames only, an IPv4 address in `198.18.0.0/15` may be accepted as a proxy-synthetic fake-IP mapping for Clash/Mihomo-style TUN DNS. Literal targets in that range remain blocked by default, and other private or special-use addresses still require explicit `allowPrivateNetwork` opt-in. Enabling cross-origin, insecure HTTP, or private-network access expands the trust boundary and should be done only for an endpoint you control.
